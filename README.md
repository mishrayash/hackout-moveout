Reducing Loading Time
This application uses a number of techniques to reduce the loading time of images and videos, including:
Lazy loading: Images are only loaded when they are visible to the user.
Image optimization: Images are optimized for web delivery.
Video streaming: Videos are streamed instead of being downloaded.


## Benefits of Reducing Loading Time:

Improved user experience: Users can start planning their trip sooner without having to wait for images and videos to load.
Increased conversion rates: Users are more likely to book travel services on websites that load quickly.
Reduced bounce rates: Users are less likely to leave a website if it loads quickly.
